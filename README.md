# BN PROJECT

The BN Project is a platform designed for testing trading strategies, encompassing both traditional methodologies and AI-driven approaches. 
Users have the flexibility to create and fine-tune their own strategies to suit their trading preferences.

Currently, the platform is under development, with new features planned for regular release post-launch. 

During this phase, Alpaca paper accounts are utilized for strategy testing, ensuring a robust and reliable trading experience.
